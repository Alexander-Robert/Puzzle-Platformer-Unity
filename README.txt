Final Project pt. 3 - Final Submission

Team: Alexander Robert, Lane Albrecht, Fiona Hsu

Controls/Objective: 
Player platform follows cursor location,
left clicking rotates the platform, holding left mouse materializes the platform
to be collidable and pressing ESCAPE key closes the game. The objective is to keep
the NPC alive throughout all the levels and to successfully finish the last level!

Playtest Postmortems: (Playtests done by Cary Daum)
     Build a House Playtest:
Aside from a couple minor holes in the map, nothing of note came from this playtest.
We already knew the objective wasn't immediately obvious as well as the controls,
but given time the player found out what to do on their own. The prototype isn't broad 
enough to find major issues or unexpected features in the game. While it looks nice
and the concept is straightforward, there isn't a whole ton for us to expand upon in 
this game.

Puzzle Platformer Playtest:
There were gameplay issues with the player platform needing to be overly precise in
its placement to allow for the NPC to use it as a platform without getting stuck or
changing direction. The player platform could also be materialized on top of the NPC
which kept it stuck inside the platform. While this didn't break the game, it is an
immersion breaking bug. The level is relatively short and doesn't provide much
gameplay to take notes from. Overall, this idea can be better structured in Unity
to be easily expandable. Changing the game to work with a tilemap will allow us to
make many more levels using different scenes. This would create a solid structure
for the workflow of expanding upon this game and implementing such a structure with
a few sample levels would demostrate major improvements to this game under the hood.
     
Final Prototype choice:
We chose the puzzle platformer prototype to continue working on because there is more
potential with that game to expand upon and restructure. Things we would want to 
change for the full game is a tilemap, several levels with a score counter and
as many new object/behaviors as we have time for.

Final Build Description: (Changes made since the prototype submission)
Art assets - created a simple theme/look for the game
Tilemap - biggest restructring component towards making an expandable game
Level transisitons - a needed feature for a prototype with multiple levels
Level designs - more content to flesh out variety of usage in objects/puzzles made.
Platform Quality of Life revisions - issues found from playtest resolved in final game
New Objects: Teleporter, Jump Pad, Buttons - more ways to add variety, complexity
and overall puzzles into the game!

All of these changes greatly improved the game in one way or another and pretty
accurately reflects the original goals we had given our initial design document
